# Convolutional-Neural-Network
CNN based model used to make predictions on the CIFAR dataset

**Dataset Used:** The dataset used to train and test the model used in the above project is the CIFAR 10 dataset. It is a multiclass dataset, which has been used here for multiclass classification purpose. Read more about the dataset at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

The type of Model used here is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). It is a special type of neural network used to detect patterns in data. 

Tools used:  
     1. Numpy   
     2. Pandas  
     3. Matplotlib  
     4. OpenCV  
     5. Tensorflow  
     6. Keras  
     7. Google Colab.
